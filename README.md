This repository contains one of the home works I had to do in CISC3130. It was one of the few that I enjoyed doing

Im not sure how I can get it to run on your computer but if you can download the java files from here and run them on a java IDE (I use eclispe) after changing the package name then you can see the program works

The homework was to create a binary search tree in java full of movies titles and their genres from a csv file then show that we can traverse through the tree and print all the nodes within the tree.

I also attached the output you would get from running the program just in case if youre unable to do so and the csv file that I used to input the data. dropped the number of movies I used in the tree to 100 because using the full files size would take up to much space in a single output file.
